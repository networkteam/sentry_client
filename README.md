TYPO3 logs error messages and exceptions to logfiles and the backend log module. This extension sends them to [Sentry](https://sentry.io/),
a SaaS/self-hosted application which aggregates them and informs you by mail. In Sentry you see a enriched error messages with
stacktrace, HTTP headers and submitted request/form data.

## Technical decisions

Exceptions through database outages (imagine a mysql server restart) should not be reported, so the db connection is checked
before. Exceptions may be excluded via regexp on their message (won't fix this error => exclude it).
TYPO3 throws a lot of PHP Notices and they are not really interesting in production, they are excluded by default.

## Installation

The preferred way is with Composer:

```bash
$ composer require networkteam/sentry-client
```

The [TER version](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/sentry_client) includes some composer dependencies locally,
which may lead to problems in the future (one package with multiple version in the project).

## Configuration

```php
// Extension Configuration
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTENSIONS']['sentry_client']['dsn'] = 'http://public_key@your-sentry-server.com/project-id';

// LocalConfiguration.php (New since 3.0!!!)
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['productionExceptionHandler'] = 'Networkteam\SentryClient\ProductionExceptionHandler';
```

### Environment variables

Since Sentry SDK 2.x there are [environment variables](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/configuration/options/#common-options) which can be used, for example in a .htaccess file:

```apacheconfig
SetEnv SENTRY_DSN http://public_key@your-sentry-server.com/project-id
SetEnv SENTRY_RELEASE 1.0.7
SetEnv SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT Staging
```

### LogWriter

The extension comes with a LogWriter which forwards messages to Sentry which normally are just logged.
You can enable it in EM or configure it for specific components:

```php
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['LOG']['YourVendor]['YourExtension]['Controller']['writerConfiguration'] = [
    \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Log\LogLevel::ERROR => [
        \Networkteam\SentryClient\SentryLogWriter::class => [],
    ]
];
```

### Feature Toggles

* Ignore database connection errors (they should better be handled by a monitoring system)
* Report user information: Select one of `none` | `userid` | `usernameandemail`
* Blacklist exception message regular expression
* LogWriter Loglevel: If set, log messages are reported to Sentry
* LogWriter Component blacklist

### Request ID

If the web server has set a request ID header `X-Request-Id`, this is transmitted as a tag to trace errors to logs.

## How to test if the extension works?

```typescript
page = PAGE
page.20 = USER
page.20 {
  userFunc = Networkteam\SentryClient\Client->captureException
}
```
This triggers an error that will be reported.
